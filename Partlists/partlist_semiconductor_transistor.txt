# how to use/read/fill this file
#
# PROPERTIES are used to set properties for all the following parts listed below
# PROPERTIES consist of two elements: a keyword and a value, separated by :
# ENTRIES are used to define a part with the properties set by the previous PROPERTIES
# ENTRIES consists of these properties, defined in the last row inside the PROPERTY definition section, separated by ;
#
# value-syntax: the value defines the type. It is not reqired, that the value contains package information.
#               This information is provided by the package property.
#
# defined PROPERTY keywords
#   VALUE           defines the value of the part
#   ORDNUM          defines the part ordering number
#   MANNUM          defines the manufacture number
#   COMMENT         defines a part comment
#	PACKAGE			defines the package property of the following parts
#	DISTRIBUTOR		defines the distributor, to who the ordering number belongs
# Each PROPERTY has to be defined within a define-section in this document.
# Position doesn't matter but it is supposed to place this section at the beginning of the file.
# Within the section, the PROPERTY-keyword is defined and there has to be added some additional information, separated by :
#	TYPE			STRING			PROPERTY has to be treated as string and whole string must match (i.e. dielectric)
#                   SUBSTRING       PROPERTY has to be treated as string and needs only to be a part of the BOM part property (i.e. package)
#					NUMBER_MAX		PROPERTY has to be treated as number and values equal or lower are better (i.e. tolerance)
#					NUMBER_EQUAL	PROPERTY has to be treated as number and value has to be exact
#					NUMBER_MIN		PROPERTY has to be treated as number and values equal or higher are better (i.e. capacitor voltage rating)
#                   UNIT            PROPERTY has to be treated as unit (should only be used for capacitors, inductors, and resistors, i.e. 1k8, 100n)
#	SYMBOL							a string, that is later searched for in the value of the BOM part, to extract the information (i.e. "%" for tolerance)
#   DEFAULT_VALUE                   a number that will be used, if the value of the part in the BOM file does not contain any further PROPERTY information
# Last line of the define-section must contain a description of the properties of each entry, separated by ;
